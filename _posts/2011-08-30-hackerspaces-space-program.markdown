<p>A few months ago we (a few hackerspaces) submitted a reply to a DARPA Request For Information.  DARPA is interested as to the type of organization that would be well suited to turn an initial investment into a long-term self-sustainable decades long space program to achieve the ambitious goal of inter-stellar space travel.  </p>
<p>Our <a href="http://xinchejian.com/2011/06/04/xinchejian-and-the-100-year-starship-study/">short document</a> was well-received and we've since been invited to both an Asian manufacturing roundtable in Singapore (next week) and to the <a href="http://www.100yss.org">100 Years Starship Symposium in Orlando</a> at the end of September.</p>
<p>In the meantime, existing efforts continues in various Hackerspaces,  such as the <a href="http://www.lunarnumbat.org">Lunar Numbat space program</a>  and the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/wiki/Space_program_of_the_Hacker_Scene:_For_our_future">Space Program track at Chaos Communication Camp</a>.</p>
<p>To get the efforts further organized, it seemed eminently reasonable to establish both <a href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Hackerspaces_Global_Space_Program">a wiki page</a> and a <a href="http://lists.hackerspaces.org/mailman/listinfo/spaceprogram">mailing list on hackerspaces.org</a>:</p>
<p>Although right now focused on the 100YSS discussion, I think we can use both resources as a focus for any space-related efforts in our respective hackerspaces - if only to catalog and showcase the efforts so far.</p>
<p>If you have an interest, I invite you (space geek!) to join the new mailing list and start the discussion.</p>
