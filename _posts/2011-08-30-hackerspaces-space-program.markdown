<p>A few months ago we (a few hackerspaces) submitted a reply to a DARPA Request For Information.  DARPA is interested as to the type of organization that would be well suited to turn an initial investment into a long-term self-sustainable decades long space program to achieve the ambitious goal of inter-stellar space travel.  </p>
<p>Our <a href="http:&#47;&#47;xinchejian.com&#47;2011&#47;06&#47;04&#47;xinchejian-and-the-100-year-starship-study&#47;">short document<&#47;a> was well-received and we've since been invited to both an Asian manufacturing roundtable in Singapore (next week) and to the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.100yss.org">100 Years Starship Symposium in Orlando<&#47;a> at the end of September.</p>
<p>In the meantime, existing efforts continues in various Hackerspaces,  such as the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.lunarnumbat.org">Lunar Numbat space program<&#47;a>  and the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;events.ccc.de&#47;camp&#47;2011&#47;wiki&#47;Space_program_of_the_Hacker_Scene:_For_our_future">Space Program track at Chaos Communication Camp<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>To get the efforts further organized, it seemed eminently reasonable to establish both <a href="http:&#47;&#47;hackerspaces.org&#47;wiki&#47;Hackerspaces_Global_Space_Program">a wiki page<&#47;a> and a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lists.hackerspaces.org&#47;mailman&#47;listinfo&#47;spaceprogram">mailing list on hackerspaces.org<&#47;a>:</p>
<p>Although right now focused on the 100YSS discussion, I think we can use both resources as a focus for any space-related efforts in our respective hackerspaces - if only to catalog and showcase the efforts so far.</p>
<p>If you have an interest, I invite you (space geek!) to join the new mailing list and start the discussion.</p>
