<h1>1月23日周三开放日更新</h1></p>
<div>
<p>Thanks to the anonymous donations this week to whoever you are, those new tools and pieces will be put to good use! This weekend we had some great events, from DorkBot to "I'm a brave robot" workshop.</p>
<p>Just a quick note: this weekend on Saturday morning the scouts are coming! from 9am til 12noon - you might want to lay in bed a little longer as they will be cutting, drilling, hammering around the space.</p>
<p>Also it's been pointed out that XinCheJian Wednesdays has been a little bit commercial, there's no excuse and we're sorry for this, i'd like to reinforce that presenters are either sent <a title="this page" href="http://xinchejian.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=98ab15cb868dfa090df3d6f81&amp;id=6a9a772546&amp;e=a21af6164b" target="_blank">http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Wednesday-guidelines</a> or informed in person, suggestions welcome for dealing with these situations on the mailing list <a href="mailto:xinchejian@googlegroups.com?subject=commercial%20presentors%20" target="_blank">xinchejian@googlegroups.com</a></p>
