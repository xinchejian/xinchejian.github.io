<p>One of the first projects people want to start in Xinchejian is the Quadcopter. We started with a group of 3 discussing about this and finding the open design we want to use online. One key criteria is we should be able to source all the components easily found in Shanghai. So, off we go. The design we picked is&nbsp;the one designed by kinderkram. It uses gyros from Wii Motion Plus and accelerometer from Shanzhaied Nunchuk. Once we decided on the design, off to&nbsp;Taobao to find the motor, ESCs and batteries. One perk of living and hacking in Shanghai is the ability to find everything made in China at the rock bottom price. Motors and components arrived with in two days. The next is about getting a frame. Walk down the street from Xinchejian is the nice neighbor windows makers. We took a look at their stocks of aluminum frame on the shelf and found a few suitable one. Ask for a few at 50 cm each and had them cut right there on the street. Gotta love being a maker in Shanghai. With a few tooling, we get the basic frame and design for the quadcoter. All in a&hellip;</p>
