<p>We have been searching for Tilapia for aquaponic for a long time. Most of sellers in China we contacted won't sell us anything less then 3000 fishes. Thanks to Jia-Qi who charmed a seller on Taobao to sell us small quantity of Tilapia fingerlings. </p>
<p>45 of these little guys made a 72 hours journey via land and air from Guangxi to Shanghai arriving at Xinchejian at 10:30 AM. 13 didn't make it. R.I.P. </p>
<p>The rest of them seem to be happy with the little tank we set up for them and hopefully we don't lose any more of them. </p>
<p>They will be joining in the aquaponic project at xinchejian contributing their part to growing the veggies and in 6 to 8 months, we will also turn them into fish sticks. ;) </p>
<p>So, when you visit xinchejian, say hello to the newest members of aquaponic project. Here are the rules of visitation: </p>
<p>1. Don't feed them. Roger and I will put them on scheduled diet. </p>
<p>2. No netting them out of water. It's bad for the fishes. </p>
<p>3. Do not name them. It will make it much harder to turn them into delicious fish sticks if they have names. </p>
