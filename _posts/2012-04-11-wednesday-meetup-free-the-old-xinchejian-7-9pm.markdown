<p>关于新车间场地搬迁日期改动以及接待外宾米奇奥特曼来访的通知</p>
<p>为了贯彻落实新车间为广大创客更好服务的精神，做好积极提高新车间软硬件环境的工作，经研究，决定将新车间场地搬迁日期推迟至2012年4月15日（周 日）晨8：30分。为了能更好的完成这次搬迁攻坚战，我们需要发动广大群众的积极性，在搬迁前日（2012年4月14日）晚8：00点开始一次史无前例的 打包清理工作，请父老乡亲们奔走相告。</p>
<p>欲行兮则悲欢共在，欢其新址之瑰丽，悲其时而不定之仓促，然，乘此新旧交替之良辰（2012年4月11日周三晚7：30分），米奇奥特曼乘风而至，另陋室 生辉无数。其人乃创客之祖，为无数创客之辈膜拜，名贯古今之奇人也。其一行人等更是高的高，矮的矮，黑的黑似炭，白的白似雪，太阳穴鼓着，腮帮子笼着，个 个是身怀绝技!今晚如若不来，将悔过今生。</p>
<p>By popular demand we _didn't_ move last weekend, in-fact this is the last week in the space. we're moving and nothing will stop us this time, hopefully by Sunday the 15th we will have lights in the new space! otherwise some members of XinCheJian will be hanging Blue and Red Florescent lights near the windows. If you would like to help with packing, 8pm @ XinCheJian on this Saturday or 8:30am on this Sunday @ XinCheJian for the move, spread the word!</p>
<p>Today, Wednesday we have the &#47;ultra-mega-wow-wednesday, a spectacular!&#47; we have Mitch Altman the Grand-daddy of hacker-spaces along with visiting Hackers, this will be the ultimate Wednesday that you will only kick yourself if you miss, check out the section below titled "Recent changes at XinCheJian" for more updates at the space!</p>
<p>This evenings confirmed presentations: 3D implants, microcontroller hacks and "car-radio-be-gone".</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday Presenters<&#47;strong><br />
<em>Mitch Altman<&#47;em> is a San Francisco-based hacker and inventor, best known for inventing TV-B-Gone remote controls, a keychain that turns off TVs in public places.&nbsp; He was also co-founder of 3ware (a Silicon Valley RAID controller company), did pioneering work in Virtual Reality at VPL Research, and created the Brain Machine, one of MAKE Magazine's most popular DIY projects. For the last many years he has been on the road from hackerspace to hacker-con leading workshops around the world, teaching one and all to make cool things with electronics and teaching everyone to solder with his open source hardware kits. Mitch is one of the co-founders of Noisebridge, a San Francisco hacker space, and President and CEO of Cornfield Electronics.</p>
<p>Mitch will talk about his newest project "car radio be gone!" also ask to see his hackerspace passport!</p>
<p><em>Tobias Schneider<&#47;em>, I am an electrical engineering student at Technische Unversitaet Muenchen. I'm interested in embedded electronics and light installations. I was part of the AllColoursAreBeautiful art installation in Munich, which was partly funded by the city. Recently I was involved in producing eco friendly, rechargeable electronic name badges for a big German maker&#47;hacker convention. I'm going to present this name badge at the Maker Carnival in Beijing and give a workshop to create own addons for the badge.</p>
<p><em>Florian Friesdorf<&#47;em>, I studied electronic engineering and system ergonomics at the Technische Universitaet Muenchen (TUM), Munich, Germany. For about two years now, I'm a fully self-employed Munich-based software developer mostly working<br />
with python and javascript. While I earn my living developing software, I'm exploring to extend that to haptic user interfaces involving wooden blocks, equipped with touch screens and sensors to measure their relative position. One application would be the hierachical modeling of workflows in health care. In cooperation with the The Department for Human Factors Engineering and Product Ergonomics at the Technische Universitaet Berlin, Germany an open source software was created. I now want to produce arduino-based prototypes of the haptic UI and am looking forward to the Maker Carnival to share thoughts and ideas.&nbsp; When not in Munich, I'm on sprints and hackerspaces around the world.</p>
<p><em>Jimmie Rodgers<&#47;em>, I am a full time hacker, maker, circuitbender, etc. I design open source hardware kits, as well as teach a variety of workshops, and give talks on many topics that interest me.&nbsp; I travel and run workshops quite a bit!&nbsp; My most popular kits are the Atari Punk Console, a simple and fun sound generator, and the LoL Shield, an Arduino shield with lots of LEDs on it!&nbsp; I am co-founder of Artisan's Asylum, a huge hackerspace in Boston.</p>
<p>Charles Paul, I am an IT consultant from New Orleans, LA. Currently the lead software developer at Pixt.com. I consult, design, develop and deliver non-trivial solutions for tricky problems; doing this in the past for Charles Schwab, Hewlett Packard, Wells Fargo, and the largest class action firm in the USA, among others. In a previous time I was also employee #1 at Metrix:CreateSpace, and am currently involved in a similar endeavor here in New Orleans. I am very much looking forward to visiting China and better learning the language!</p>
<p><em>Yair reshef,<&#47;em> An art technologist and educator, consulting some of the leading art and design institutes in Israel. In this capacity I help promote creative technology in the arts and vise verse. A recent such example is fabrication of an hepatic car wheel for a year long collaboration between Bezalel academy of Arts and General motors. as an educator I give workshops and help people experience rapid prototyping of electronics and code. My students ranging from small kids to teachers and faculty. Coming from Israel, I keep a close watch on our start-up culture, and am always amazed by the power of a few committed talents to bring things to be.</p>
<p><em>Simon Schubert<&#47;em> , I'm an EE major converted to Computer Science PhD student, currently studying in Lausanne, Switzerland. While doing my EE studies, I balanced myself by being a developer for the DragonFly BSD Operating System; now that I'm doing Computer Science, I picked up electronics as a hobby. Besides being a member of our local hackerspace, I am a (inactive) HAM radio operator and I keep dismantling and hacking various electronic and mechanical items in my house. My latest venture is a cheap, compact and powerful microcontroller development platform, the MC HCK (http:&#47;&#47;mchck.org).</p>
<p>Simon will be giving a talk on micro controller hacks</p>
<p><em>Jacob Rosenthal<&#47;em>, I'm a freelance embedded and erstwhile web and database developer. I've spent the last two years founding and educating at the Phoenix Arizona hackerspace HeatSync Labs where I am still on the board of directors. My personal interests include body computing and modification, 3d printing, and electronics. I am passionate about making the future practical.</p>
<p>Jacob will be giving a talk on 3D implants!<br />
<strong>Recent changes at XinCheJian<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Membership is now Just 100rmb per month per member, for an additional 200rmb a month you can also store your projects&#47;stuff in the space in a box that does not exceed 50x50x30cm, you can contribute more money if you want as a donation. Failure to pay membership will result in your junk being stored at XinCheJian becoming a donation to the space. XinCheJian will no longer offer community parts but instead sell them in sets, for example 10 resistors for 1rmb to cut down on waste and mess. Members will have access to the space and the tools, strangers must be accompanied by a member at all times and will be responsible for that friend during that period at XinCheJian.
