<p>Kevin Xie from <a href="http://china.xilinx.com/">Xilinx</a> (<a href="http://china.xilinx.com/university/index.htm">University Program</a> Greater China manager) came by to visit XinCheJian last Sunday as he's very interested in helping Hackerspaces in China. He sees Hackerspaces like XinCheJian as a potential opportunity for students to apply the knowledge they gain in university in real devices while inspiring them to do cool stuff.  </p>
<p>Xilinx programmable logic devices is what is powering many industrial strength devices and an important building block in any larger project.  Xilinx offer capabilities that complement micro-controllers very well when continuous signal  processing is needed.  This could offer us interesting alternatives to real-time sensors data processing and actuators control in a very compact package.</p>
