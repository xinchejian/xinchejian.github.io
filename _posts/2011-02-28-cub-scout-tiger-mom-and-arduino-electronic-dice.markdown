<p><a href="https://twitter.com/theliuyan">@theliuyan</a> just posted a few pictures from the Sunday's Cub Scout event. It was fun to introduce some hardware hacking to cub scouts. I think they enjoyed it with their great group of supportive parents. Just put Tiger Mom on the title for SEO. ;) The activity is part of their scout engineering and we were making <a href="http://xinchejian.com/?p=501">Electronics Dice.</a></p></p>
