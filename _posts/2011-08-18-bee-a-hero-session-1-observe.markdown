<p>HI HACKERS!</p>
<p>NEED A BREAK WITH YOUR ROBOT? Well, the wild bees need your skills.</p>
<p>Become a bee hero, join the goldendusters.&nbsp;<em><a href="http:&#47;&#47;goldensdusters.com">Goldendust<&#47;a> <&#47;em>is a global design project about pollination service. It aims to provide immediate efficient and desirables solutions to the phenomenon of bee&nbsp;extinction.</p>
<p>Xinchejian is hosting a small scale wild bees refuge which is a flag product easy to put on your balcony or window. This way you can provide to them a safe habitat while they are pollinating flowers around.</p>
<p>We invite everyone, hacker and non hacker to think about how we can boost &nbsp;man-bees interactions : being able to observe, count the bees and integrate the refuge into modern farming practices is building a strong experience and help raise awareness.</p>
<p>You are welcome to brainstorm, online (by leaving your comments, post sketches...), at the space or by writing at infoshumus@gmail.com.</p>
<p>We will build a bee refuge during the workshop on <strong>saturday 20th!<&#47;strong></p>
<p><strong>SESSION 1 : OBSERVE<&#47;strong></p>
<p>We open the first session with the question : <strong>How to observe the bees?<&#47;strong></p>
<p><strong> <&#47;strong>Help us to build a pictures bank that will serve local research. Help us find cheap solutions to observe the bees. Webcam, snapshot, bee robot?</p>
<p><strong><br />
