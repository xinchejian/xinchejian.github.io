<a href="http://xinchejian.com">XinCheJian Hackerspace</a>, the first Hackerspace in China, is proud to announce that it has been accepted in the <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2011/07/27/write-a-step-by-step-instruction-win-200-coupon/">Seeedstudio Toy Hacking contest</a>.  We will receive two Grove kits for the purpose of hacking two toys from the OpenHardware company in Shenzhen.  They are given us the opportunity of winning a 200$USD grand prize gift certificate and a 100$USD first prize certificate.  Our entries to the contest will consist of two projects that will use as much as possible the various electronic components included in the kit.</p>
<p>The first project is the transformation of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneki_Neko">beckoning cat  (招財貓)</a> that is often seen in store as a good-luck charm to attract business.  We want to turn it into a fun and interactive experience. The project, led by Severin Schols (an experienced German hacker) will be done in collaboration with XinCheJian hackers out of the Shanghai Hackerspace.  Our beckoning cyber-cat will have additional surprising abilities that will make them even cuter than usual.  Such an iconic device transformed into something more will make a great impression on people seeing it.  </p>
<p>The second project will consist in adding extra fun functions on one roboracing robot.  We have many teams that have a robot or have started building their own through our weekend robo-racing workshops. The Grove kit will be made available to anyone that wants to add extra functions.  We've noticed in our first two competitions (June and July) that fun but not necessarily useful features gave great pleasure to the audience: honking, flashing lights and more interactivity when handling the robot car.  The Grove toy kits will make an awesome addition to these robot cars and we expect quite a few participants to be interested in using it.</p>
<p>Thanks to Hao Zhang (haozhang@seeedstudio.com) we've already received the two kits with some additional parts for our specific projects (such as a mobile platform and servos).  The parts are available to anyone who wants to work on a winning entry for XinCheJian! XinCheJian has until September 15th to send in our designs with step-by-step instructions for the two projects.<br />

<a href="http://xinchejian.com">新车间</a>创客空间, 作为中国的第一个创客空间 (Hackerspace), 非常高兴地宣布我们已入围了<a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2011/07/27/write-a-step-by-step-instruction-win-200-coupon/">Seeed Studio的玩具改装大赛</a>。我们将会收到来自这家深圳开源硬件企业送出的两份Grove 套装，套装里包含的模块能让我们轻松地进行玩具改装。我们也因此获得了赢取特等奖200美金和一等奖100美金的机会。我们的两个参赛项目将会尽可能地使用套装里的所有电子模块。</p>
<p>第一个项目是招财猫大变身。招财猫通常摆放在店铺的柜台，用于招揽顾客和财气。我们的改装将会使它更有趣，而且还能跟顾客互动。这个项目的负责人是Severin Schols （一个经验丰富的德国创客），他将会和上海新车间的其他创客们合作完成招财猫的大变身。新车间的电子招财猫将具备有趣的附加功能，使它变得比平常更可爱！一个传统的摆设品与开源硬件的结合，将会给人们留下深刻的印象。</p>
<p>第二个项目是改装竞赛机器车，为其添加更多有趣的功能。在我们周末举行的机器车竞赛工作坊里，有许多队伍已经拥有机器车，或者正在组装自己的机器车。而另一份Grove套件将会提供给那些想要对机器车进行升级改装的队伍。我们通过前两次机器车竞赛（6月份和7月份）发现，那些虽然不实用但很有趣的功能将会为我们的观众带来巨大的欢乐：汽车的喇叭声，闪光和操作过程中的互动。Grove套装正好能带来有趣的升级，我们预期会有不少的队伍对此感兴趣。</p>
<p>最后，感谢Seeed Studio，我们已经收到两份Grove套装，还有其他为我们两个项目特备的零件（移动小车平台和伺服马达）。大家可以利用这些套件，为新车间赢得比赛！我们将会在9月15号把我们的设计和项目教程递交到Seeed Studio。<br />
