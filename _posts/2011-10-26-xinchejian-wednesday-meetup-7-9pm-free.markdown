<p>For the lock picking research group, it's time to grind your own picks, Michael has printed out the templates so come see and come do, it's time to have your own tools of the trade.</p></p>
<p>EL Wire introduction, come see the coolest thing since sliced bread, Just in time for Halloween - readily available in shanghai, weave/thread/stick/sow this stuff into clothing to create futuristic attire.</p></p>
