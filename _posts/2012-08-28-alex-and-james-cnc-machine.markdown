<p>James is doing it because he wants a tool to build space-grade components for micro-satellites. Alex is in it because he likes smacking things with tools, and is forging a great relationship with a sexy little socket wrench...</p>

<!--:--><a id="more"></a><a id="more-3785"></a><!--:en-->We have Lio to thank for helping out with the Arduino code. Alex's attempts at this were non-existent, and James's were...sub-optimal. Lio was the lightning bolt to our Doctor Frankenstein. We put the body together, but he wrote the code that made our monster LIVE! Well, at least jiggle about a bit before devolving into a grinding mess.</p>

<p>We're mostly making up things as we go along at this point (and for that matter, throughout the whole project), and last night we just got the X-axis gantry installed. If only the coupling was a bit smaller we could attach our grunty little motor and get things moving properly. The way it is now, it just grinds away, rattling against the axis of the ballscrew.</p>
<p>Next steps are to get a decent coupling and attach the gantry so that it doesn't wobble like a drunken jelly trying to disco dance.<!--:--></p>
