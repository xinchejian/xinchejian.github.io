Severin reports on his progress:</p>
<p>Started working on the beckoning cat last night, so I wanted to give you<br />
an update about the progress. Took the cat apart, and got as far as attaching the arm to one servo, so it should now be able to move back and forth, like it's traditionally supposed to, just that we can control the motion. Took a whole bunch of pictures and I'll start writing some step-by-step instructions in the next few days.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to help me on the project, let me know. More people, more<br />
ideas, and a more awesome cat ;)<br />

Severin谈及他的进度：</p>
<p>昨晚开始对招财猫进行改装，现在我想汇报一下进度。先把招财猫拆开，目前已经将它的手臂接上了伺服马达。现在这只手臂不仅能像以前那样前后摆动，而且我们还能控制它的动作。已经对其拍照，接下来我会开始写这个改装的分步教程。</p>
<p>如果有谁想跟我一起完成这个项目，欢迎联系我。让更多人参与进来，更多的点子，更多有趣的招财猫；）<br />
