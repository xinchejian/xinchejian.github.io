<p>Xinchejian is the first hackerspace in Shanghai. It's a space for hackers, tinkers, artists and hobbyists who are interested in playing with physical computing, digital art, robotics and everything connecting the physical worlds to the digital world.</p>
<p>Xinchejian has been in operation for a month. We  now run an Arduino workshop, have several groups working on different projects such as quadcopters, urban farming rack and etc.</p>
<p>We'd like to invite more people interested in doing DIY and like to get their hand dirty to make some magic to join us.</p>
<p>We are located at 50 Yongjia Lu.</p>
