<p><!--:zh-->Helper Sessions and Assistive Devices group is growing, another new member joined last week and is learning Arduino - from blinking LED to accelerometer! A big feature was added to the air-mouse - a virtual mouse button. The virtual button (gesture) is controlled by horizontal shaking as seen in the video. You can also see the mouse control needs a little fine tuning.  &nbsp; <object width="480" height="400" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" align="middle"><param name="src" value="http://player.youku.com/player.php/sid/XNTk1NTIzOTQw/v.swf" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed width="480" height="400" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://player.youku.com/player.php/sid/XNTk1NTIzOTQw/v.swf" allowfullscreen="true" quality="high" allowscriptaccess="always" align="middle" /></object> </p>
<p> &nbsp;<a title="Virtual button air-mouse code." href="https://github.com/xinchejian/AssistiveDevices/tree/master/FreeIMU_inertial_mouse_leonardo_Teensy">Code is is on github</a>. The Helper sessions are about sharing and learning anything. The Assistive devices are used as one focus for learning. </p>
<p>&nbsp;If you would like to join in and just explore a big range of hardware including the new Xadow, a wearable Arduino, that has eight add on modules and a wearable frame to mount the modules inside, all just shipped directly from the SeeedStudio research lab - hence at least one minor issue to fix. There are also bluetooth devices, 3D printing, eyetracking and heaps of code to write, so come and join in Thursday night from 7:30, no experience required, just Xinchejian membership.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;Group members also arrange to meet at other times, so make contact directly or via the mailing list to arrange! Several wiki updates including this <a title="Things to do!" href="http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Tasks_-_progress_updates_%26_Help_wanted">new page</a> for heaps more good stuff to work on!&nbsp; More information is <a title="Assistive Devices" href="http://wiki.xinchejian.com/wiki/Assistive_Devices">here </a>and <a title="Helper sessions" href="http://xinchejian.com/2013/07/05/helper-sessions-at-xinchejian/">here</a>.<!--:--><!--:en--> <object width="300" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" align="middle"><param name="src" value="http://player.youku.com/player.php/sid/XNTk1NTIzOTQw/v.swf" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed width="300" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://player.youku.com/player.php/sid/XNTk1NTIzOTQw/v.swf" allowfullscreen="true" quality="high" allowscriptaccess="always" align="middle" /></object> </p>
