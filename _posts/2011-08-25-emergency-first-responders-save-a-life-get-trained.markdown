At XinCheJian we use tools on a day to day basis that could inflict serious harm so we want to take steps to be there in the unlikely event of an emergency.</p>
<p><em>NOTICE: This is not a license to repair a person, it will provide you  the skills and confidence to act as a first responder and when used  prudently can equip you with the necessary life saving skills.</em></p>
