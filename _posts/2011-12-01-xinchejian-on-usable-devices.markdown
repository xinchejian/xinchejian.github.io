<p><!--:en-->Spencer from the new website&nbsp;<a href="http://usabledevices.com">Usable Devices</a>&nbsp;("<em>Devices that work, those that don't and those that need to be created!</em>") has already some interesting writing on its blog with both technical articles such as an attempt to build a robot for the <a href="http://usabledevices.com/2011/10/28/relaxation-project-building-an-autonomous-maze-solving-car/">next roborace</a>, a&nbsp;flattering article towards XinCheJian with a profile of <a href="http://usabledevices.com/2011/11/20/inspirational-people-part-3/">two out of the three founders</a> (the other being of course Min Lin Hsieh) and a report on the presentation from <a href="http://usabledevices.com/2011/12/01/makesense-challenges-hackers-and-makers-to-attend-holdup/">MakeSense</a> at the<a href="http://xinchejian.com/2011/11/28/makesense-at-xcj-on-wed-nov-30th/"> last Wednesday Open House</a>. Always interesting for us to get an outsider perspective to our space and insights in more of the local projects!<!--:--></p>
