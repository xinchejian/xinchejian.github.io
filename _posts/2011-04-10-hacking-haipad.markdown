<p>Ricky just <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.element14.com&#47;community&#47;groups&#47;xinchejian-gghc&#47;blog&#47;2011&#47;04&#47;10&#47;digging-into-the-head-of-the-xinchejian-robot-the-haipad-m701-and-its-tcc8902-chipset" target="_blank">posted a detail article<&#47;a> on hacking HaiPad m701!</p>
<blockquote><p>
The M701 in itself is an example of hacking in China: here, hacking hardware that wasn't thought to be workable together to achieve something close to a device that is much more expensive is not called a hobby but a full-time job!<br&#47;><br&#47;></p>
<p>Like many others, the extremely low-cost of this 7 inch tablet is made out of a even lower cost chipset, the Telechips 8902.  The Telechips was originally designed to fit high end automotive applications, not do tablets or robotics.  This chipset powers a variety of similar devices: Augen Gentouch, Coby Kyros, HSG X5A, Haipad M701, Dawa D7, SmartQ v5&#47;v7, Coby Kyros MID7005&#47;MID7015, Imito iM7, Smartbook Surfer (Pictures)<br&#47;><br&#47;></p>
<p>"Shanzhai" integrators prefer to keep their supply chain discreetly low-profile as they consider it their "secret" sauce.  This is because in Shenzhen, manufacturers are in a race to produce a whole bunch and sell them before the local competitors do the same, often advertising capabilities of the underlying chipset that are actually unavailable to the user since unsupported by the OS.<br&#47;><&#47;br><br />
