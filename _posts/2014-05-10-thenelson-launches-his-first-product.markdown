<p>So for those that might remember or have met theNelson, he dropped out of berkley by taking the&nbsp;thiel fellowship&nbsp;<a title="ThielFellowship" href="http:&#47;&#47;thielfellowship.org?fpwl">thielfellowship.org<&#47;a>&nbsp;(resize the browser to see him on the right side) and has now released his first product of that, think social, think sharing, think music.. it's all that in one! <a href="http:&#47;&#47;campaign.wearhaus.com&#47;?fpwl">http:&#47;&#47;campaign.wearhaus.com&#47;<&#47;a>&nbsp;- If you are a member of XinCheJian contact staff@xinchejian.com for a discount code! theNelson is&nbsp;a special case, he joined XinCheJian in the early days on An Hua lu space, many many hours were given, he ran Designing your own PCB workshops which got a lot of people started almost 3 years ago, designed the first robo-racing shield that most still use and hack for other purposes and drops by as much as he can, he's back mid may for a drop in to update us on how his new venture is going, oh, and i (Paul) still don't think he's 21! This is one small step for him in his future, we expect many many more! Here's a few links and a funny photo i dug up:</p>
