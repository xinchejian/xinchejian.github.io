<p>Executive summary: toys RC are so cheap in China that it would be a crime not to give a shot at using them to make robots. The challenges encountered are a cool and effective way to learn more about electronics and electricity in general&hellip; And I&rsquo;ve wanted to do this kind of stuff for many, many years! I bought an RC car from Taobao at the extremely cheap price of 67RMB (shipping included! 10$USD!). http:&#47;&#47;item.taobao.com&#47;item.htm?id=7905841099 For that price, you get an RC remote, a rechargeable Ni-Cd 400mAh&#47;6V battery pack, the radio transmitter (27.145Mhz). Wheels have rubber, autonomy and range is decent although the chassis is very very cheap plastic obviously. The downsides: on wood floor, it tends to spin so any autonomous program would need to constantly adjust based on sensor (distance ranging) input. It also has propulsion motors on a simple shock so the base isn&rsquo;t totally flat with the ground. The transmitter needed two AA batteries (not included!) so I ran out late at night to buy a pair of them (6RMB) and went on an excursion in the cold night to acquire a bunch of precision screwdrivers (25RMB, although really they&rsquo;re worth 15). Pretty difficult achievement since&hellip;</p>
