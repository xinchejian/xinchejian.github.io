<p><strong>=Recent changes at XinCheJian=<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Membership is now Just 100rmb per month per member, for an additional 200rmb a month you can also store your projects&#47;stuff in the space in a box that does not exceed 50x50x30cm, you can contribute more money if you want as a donation. Failure to pay membership will result in your junk being stored at XinCheJian becoming a donation to the space. XinCheJian will no longer offer community parts but instead sell them in sets, for example 10 resistors for 1rmb to cut down on waste and mess. Members will have access to the space and the tools, strangers must be accompanied by a member at all times and will be responsible for that friend during that period at XinCheJian. For Full details see <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.xinchejian.com&#47;wiki&#47;Policy">http:&#47;&#47;wiki.xinchejian.com&#47;wiki&#47;Policy<&#47;a> or <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.xinchejian.com&#47;wiki&#47;Policy&#47;zh">http:&#47;&#47;wiki.xinchejian.com&#47;wiki&#47;Policy&#47;zh<&#47;a><!--:--><!--:zh-->XinChejian is still under construction but that wont stop us from keeping up with our promise of a Wednesday meetup, we've got 2 presentations this evening along with a sneak peek at the new space.</p>
