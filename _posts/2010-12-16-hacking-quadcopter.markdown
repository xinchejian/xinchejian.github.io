<p>One of the first projects people want to start in Xinchejian is the Quadcopter. We started with a group of 3 discussing about this and finding the open design we want to use online. One key criteria is we should be able to source all the components easily found in Shanghai. So, off we go. The design we picked is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.rcgroups.com&#47;forums&#47;showthread.php?t=1332876">the one<&#47;a> designed by kinderkram. It uses gyros from Wii Motion Plus and accelerometer from Shanzhaied Nunchuk. <a title="Quadcopter" href="http:&#47;&#47;xinchejian.com&#47;?page_id=71">Read More<&#47;a>...</p>
