<p>XinCheJian is looking for people to join in the "Goldendust pollination" project.</p>
<p>What is the Goldendust project? A collaborative reflexion toward the preservation of the bees in town involving researchers, designers and urban thinkers centered around the creation of wild bees refuges.</p>
<p>There's many technological challenges to this project: take pictures of the bees, count how many bees are using the refuge, keep the refuge orientated towards the sun at all time.  It's also a big component in existing urban farming practices to pollinate plants.</p>
<p>For more information, contact: infoshumus@gmail.com.  A workshop led by Aurelie "Lili" Moyon has been tentatively scheduled for <a href="http://xinchejian.com/?page_id=548&regevent_action=register&event_id=42&name_of_event=Preserve%20the%20Wild%20Bees%20Workshop">August 14th 2011</a> depending on how many people sign up.</p>
