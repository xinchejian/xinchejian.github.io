<p>Alex update on the progress of the new Botmill 3d printer:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was working on the 3d printer with Mike last Saturday and the parts for the frame, Z and Y axes are almost ready and calibrated.</p>
<p>We are missing some parts to assemble the motors and the head. And the X axis is still work in progress.</blockquote><br />
It's a bit strange that Botmill would sell kits with missing parts (M4 threaded 70mm rod,&nbsp;M4 insert, etc). Some of the reprap parts are low quality (misprinted gears) and you have to be extra careful tightening nuts as I've accidentally cracked the extruder carriage.</p>
<p>Work on this will continue on Wednesday evening at the space; feel free to help out!<!--:--><!--:zh--><img style="display:block;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;" alt="image" src="http://xinchejian.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/wpid-1321332327572.jpg" /></p>
