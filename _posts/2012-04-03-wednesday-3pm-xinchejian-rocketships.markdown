<p>This will be the <em>last Wednesday in the old space</em>, given that it's a holiday we're adjusting the time to be able to bring you an explosive get together during the day, read on for more.</p>
<p>Just a quick reminder, we kindly ask that those with "stuff" in XinCheJian remove it before the 8th and anything left behind will be considered a donation, if you would like to help with the moving we'll have a packing party on the 7th, send an message on Weibo or here if you'd like to help out.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday presentations</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wednesday will start at 3:00pm <strong>not</strong> 7pm due to the speakers availability and the holiday, this is a <em>one time only</em> and we will return to the regular time next week.</span></p>

<p><strong>A quick blurb about XinCheJian</strong></p>
<p>XinCheJian is a community run hackerspace located in the heart of Shanghai, without your support with time, workshops, donations and memberships we would not be able to keep the space alive and in the same form as it is today, think about giving back in any way you can and help alleviate the financial responsibilities. We have starter memberships from 300rmb a month with most members opting to take out a 500rmb membership a month to support the community, by being a member you'll get access to the space whenever and workshops at the component price, we even have startup memberships for people looking to build a business and gain access to the space and tools at off hours.</p>

As a Volunteer you'll earn your membership, you'll also be expected to joinStaff meetings at least once a month. Only apply if you're serious. Without the generosity of the current volunteers and sharing tasks in their free time, it would be near impossible to keep XinCheJian alive.</p>
