<p><!--:en-->Makers and Breakers, hello again from XinCheJian. Its Wednesday already, we're at it again, its time to get off the couch or out of the rain and come and hang out with us at XinCheJian and make stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Tonights topics</strong></p>
<p>Tonight we should have three interesting topics, Farming in an Urban window presented by Jeff followed up with the 8x8x8 cube you might have previously seen on the mailing list.. if anyone knows the 8x8x8 cube takes some serious multiplexing.. find out how many pins this guy uses!<br />
Also Raven will start the show with his awesome processing introduction for those who might be interested in signing up to the processing workshop.</p>

<p>XinCheJian is run by volunteers, by donating time, toys or money can the space continue to be what it is. If you're interested in being part of the group we have several positions open for volunteers or those looking for a community driven internship at the end of this newsletter. If you cannot help out by taking a membership then consider buying a drink from the fridge or even kits, every little helps.</p>
