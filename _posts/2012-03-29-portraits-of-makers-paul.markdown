  content: "This is Si Woo Kim from Art Center Nabi, located at Seoul, Korea\r\nLet
    me introduce who we are first,\r\nWe are the first media art center in Korea (founded
    1999) and still the best media art related center \r\n(We call technology based
    art as media art)\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nHomepage: www.nabi.or.kr\r\nExhibition:
    http://blog.naver.com/art_nabi/60210345793\r\nHackathon: http://blog.naver.com/art_nabi/60199823207\r\nEvent:
    http://blog.naver.com/art_nabi/60205750760\r\n\r\nRecently, we
    are very interested in maker movement and we work with Fab lab Seoul and many
    of makers \r\nMoreover, we are focus on building international networks such as
    Fab cafe Shibuya (Japan), Fab lab Barcelona etc\r\nOur director, Roh So Young,
    is going to go to Shanghai very soon and she loves to meet makers from Shanghai
    \r\nI was wondering, you (or anybody) could help her to discuss about maker movement
    in Shanghai and China?\r\nand any other maker space or person you would recommend
    to visit or meet?\r\n\r\nAs a foreigner, It is not easy to access to Chinese Community,
    especially lack of Chinese language ability\r\n(I guess you could understand it
    very well)\r\nI really hope you could help us\r\n\r\nBest Regard,\r\n\r\nSi Woo

<dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/76398697@N08/7000526667/"><img title="Paul" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6101/7000526667_6d5a3b2c77_z.jpg" alt="Paul" width="426" height="640" /></a></dt></dl></div><br />
Who are you?<br />
I&rsquo;m not a superhero or that guy from the big bang theory, I am however closer to a human than those would think, I am Paul Adams.</p>
<p>What do you do?<br />
Some say I run the United states of America, but I don&rsquo;t believe that, by education I&rsquo;m a Graphic Designer by industry I&rsquo;m a one man web development company.</p>
<p>What inspires you?<br />
The learning process is inspirational but doing anything with stuff is just the greatest!</p>
<p>What attracts you to the space/what do you like about the space?<br />
I like the makers, and I like making stuff, the crazy projects with the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk about it, go do it&ldquo; mentality is awesome. Plus if you&rsquo;ve been around long enough you&rsquo;ll start to learn things you never thought possible. An example is my first few visits to XinCheJian, I was hacking my first robot &ndash; a Hovercraft. I had no idea where to begin or what I was doing, it was He Qichen who took 10 minutes to give me the brief introduction to using a multimeter and I was setup and burning stuff quicker than you could scream &lsquo;FIRE!&rdquo;</p>
<p>XinCheJian is a new experience, the fact you have the opportunity to do anything is mind blowing, the chance to share the chance to learn whilst being around like-minded people is phenomenal.</p>
<p>I love the fact that the entire hackerspace community is not pretentious; true, honest people doing real things, you need to get your hands dirty, you need to build stuff. &ldquo;Talkers walk but makers provoke!&rdquo; (yes I should work on that one)</p>
<p>What do you want to do/accomplish/learn/share/experience?<br />
I want to do something, accomplish many tasks, and learn as much as I can, share everything and experience both the good and bad, i have a thirst for experiencing new things, I also love the idea of being a pioneer.</p>
<p>If there is only one thing you could share with people, what would it be?</p>
<p>It would have to be how much I don&rsquo;t know, especially some of those technical conversations that happen, I just nod my head in agreement and every now and then say &ldquo;interesting, tell me more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tell us a secret.. One you haven't told anyone else?<br />
This last year has been fulfilling, I&rsquo;ve thoroughly enjoyed it, loved the bad and enjoyed the good, I wouldn&rsquo;t change it.</p>
<p>Who's your idol?<br />
Lady Ada (Limor) is my idol.</p>
<p>Where would you rate yourself on a geeky slider? (or nerdy if you are that way)<br />
I would rate myself at 42 on the geeky slider out of 63, 2/3rd geek.<!--:--><!--:zh-->

<dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/76398697@N08/7000526667/"><img title="Paul" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6101/7000526667_6d5a3b2c77_z.jpg" alt="Paul" width="426" height="640" /></a></dt></dl></div><br />
1）你是谁？<br />
我不是一个超级英雄，或者那个生活大爆炸剧集里的那个男孩子，与那些形象相比我会觉得自己更接近一个人，我是Paul Adams。</p>
<p>2)你是从事什么的？<br />
有人说我从美国落跑，但是我并不这么认为，通过教育我是工业图片设计师，我也是一个人的网络开发公司。</p>
<p>3)什么激励了你？<br />
这种学习的过程就是一种激励，但是这样做的东西就很棒！</p>
<p>4)什么吸引你来到新车间/你喜欢新车间哪个方面？<br />
我喜欢这种制造者，我也喜欢做东西，这种&ldquo;不空谈，动手做的&rdquo;疯狂的项目的思考方法是让人惊叹的。加之假如你已经在这里好久了，你可以开始学习你从不认为可能的事情。一个例子就是我第一次访问新车间，我劈开我第一个机器人&mdash;一条气垫船。我对正在做的事情感到无从下手，就是He Qichen（请告诉我中文名字的写法），他用了10分钟给我做了这个万用表使用方法的简短的介绍，让我装备上之后以比你尖叫＂着火了＂还快的速度，迅速烧掉了这个东西。<br />
新车间是一种新的体验，事实上你有机会作你思想中闪现的任何事情，有机会分享学习的机会,当周围正环绕着志趣相投的人们是效果显著的。<br />
事实上我喜欢整个的创客空间交流并不是自命不凡；真实，坦诚的人们制作真正的东西，你需要的让你的手变脏，你需要建造事物。&ldquo;空谈家滚蛋，但创造者被激励&rdquo;（使得我应该成为在那里工作的一员）。</p>
<p>5)你想要做些什么/完成/学习/分享一些什么经验？<br />
我想做一些东西，完成很多测试，并尽可能多的学习，分享每件事和经验无论好还是坏，我渴望拥有做新东西的经验，我也热爱成为先锋的创意。</p>
<p>6)假如你只能分享一件事情给大家，你想分享什么？<br />
它不得不取决于我未知的领域有多少，特别是开展一些技术讨论，我只是时常点着我的头同意然后说：&ldquo;真有趣，请告诉我更多。&rdquo;</p>
<p>7)告诉我们一个秘密&hellip;&hellip;你从来么有告诉过其他人的秘密？<br />
去年已经非常满意，我已经完全的彻底的享受它，深爱它的坏并享受它的好，我不会改变它。</p>
<p>8)谁是你的偶像？<br />
Ada女士是我的偶像。</p>
<p>9)在创客方面你会怎样评价自己？（或者书呆子假如你是这样的）<br />
我会评估自己在63创客滑块上可以有42的位置，我是二分之三的创客。<!--:--></p>
