<p>A quick thank you to all the friends and presenters of XinCheJian who<br />
managed to make it to Occupy Barcamp, We had an Epic turnout and<br />
XinCheJian really did a great job to Occupy Barcamp in Shanghai this<br />
year, find out how we're taking it up a notch and heading to capital<br />
to Occupy the Maker Faire next month.</p>
<p>This weekend is the start of the Jue Festival dedicated to Music, Arts<br />
and Technology that XinCheJian is involved in and supporting all<br />
through the hard-work of Ziyun Peng.</p>
<h1>Tonight's Presentations</h1></p>
<p>We have Derek Zhang coming down from his hobbyist store and bringing<br />
some things that he's developed, last week he showed us some videos of<br />
boat racers able to hit 90km/h and copters of sorts - flying stunt<br />
patterns, he has a strong footing in the shanghai R/C crowd and<br />
invites us all to come play.</p>

<h1>A quick blurb about XinCheJian</h1></p>
<p>XinCheJian is a community run hackerspace located in the heart of<br />
Shanghai, without your support we would not be able to keep the space<br />
alive and in the same form as it is today, think about giving back in<br />
any way you can and help alleviate the financial responsibilities. We<br />
have starter memberships from 300rmb a month with most members opting<br />
to take out a 500rmb membership a month to support the community, by<br />
being a member you'll get access to the space whenever and workshops<br />
at the lessor price, we even have Startup memberships for people<br />
looking to build a business and gain access to the space and tools<br />
during 9-5 office hours.</p>
<h1>Volunteer Jobs at XinCheJian</h1><br />
As a Volunteer you'll earn your membership, you'll also be expected to<br />
join Staff meetings at least once a month. Only apply if you're<br />
serious. Without the generosity of the current volunteers and sharing<br />
tasks in their free time, it would be near impossible to keep<br />
XinCheJian alive.</p>
<p><strong>Treasurer</strong><br />
As the Treasurer you'll be responsible for.. treasure. you need to<br />
<strike>have your own calculator</strike> we'll provide you a<br />

basis.</p>

<p>A Journalist will be expected to write at least 1 article a week on a<br />
topic of whats going on inside XinCheJian, you pick a project and<br />
review it, can be a few hours an evening writing and a few hours in<br />
the day interviewing.</p>
