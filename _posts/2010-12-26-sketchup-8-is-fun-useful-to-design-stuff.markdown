<p>One of the big challenge of building robots is to come up with good electromechanical designs. &nbsp;<a href="http://sketchup.google.com/">Google Sketchup</a> (now at version 8 ) is free and, as far as 3D software go, very easy-to-use with many features permitting coming up with useful plans for your next robot. &nbsp;Most useful for the 3D-challenged however is the <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/">3D Warehouse</a> with user-contributed models. You can, for example, find a model of the <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=65ebac1e83702f15bf5a7d4d00dbf624&amp;prevstart=0">Arduino Dueminalove</a> and a range of sensors (such as the <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=b66a105deff26b3912d769db18b928d7&amp;prevstart=0">Parallax Ping</a> or the <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=266adab594bd3d2bd7053d86bc3efcb6&amp;ct=mdrm&amp;prevstart=0">Sharp IR sensor</a>) in addition to parts such as&nbsp;<a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=6bab44cbd8a82b7e80c73b110d74d94f&amp;prevstart=0">servomotor</a> and <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=72d4244540e81c671d9826a79afd9186&amp;prevstart=0">RC chassis</a>. &nbsp;These can be directly inserted into your design by simply going to File > 3D Warehouse > Get Models.</p>
<p>The downside is that you'll need to buy the <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/product/gsup.html">pricey pro version</a> (500$USD) to get the export features - which will be handy when you when to get your mechanical parts produced. But if you're a Xinchejian member and working on a fun project, feel free to ask me to export your model to one of the <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=36203">many formats available</a>.</p>
<p>(Disclosure: I work for the company that makes Sketchup, however I don't currently have any relationship with the team.)</p>
