<p><!--:en-->We hope by now that your Christmas gifts have broken and that you have already started hacking them! we've got a great line up this week of presenters, also keep an eye for Dork Bot announcement to be hosted on the 19th. Since it's a new year, why not be more active and make something! make stuff!</p>
<p>This weeks lineup is as follows: Rick Sheridan, an expert in sourcing components. Hailing a NY storyteller, Colt Ma, and his Arduino based coffee roaster! Lobtail is flying in to show-off cloud-lab and 1626 潮流双周刊 magazine will be interviewing people!</p>
<p>=Wednesday Presenters/本周演讲者介绍=</p>
<p>Rick Sheridan, CEO of RST in San Francisco and friend of Mitch Altman will be presenting this evening, his expertise is in management of sourcing for OEMS and i bet he has some hairy stories to share.</p>
<p>Hailing from Shanghai, China, Dd ( Yang Jiang 江暘 ) is a New-York based visual storyteller that incorporates a multitude of mediums such as photography, painting, videography, interactive design and more into her art. For her, art is an essential way to approach her inner-self as well as  the mysteries of nature. She attempts to honor both timeless wonders in the nature and the time-bound world of form. Now, she is pursuing her second master&rsquo;s degree at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU, where she is developing new modalities to integrate the beauty and intelligence of nature into the everyday lives of people.</p>
<p>自动咖啡烘焙机：项目刚起步，原型机Mark I基于一台小型爆米花机+arduino改造而来，通过大量的测试调整，已有了比较稳定的效果。 - The Arduino based coffee roaster Mark I ! based on an old popcorn machine.</p>
<p>Lobtail the creator of cloud-lab is building an interesting community tool, a virtual hackerspace with tools and equipment available for loan and projects published and collaboratively worked on.<!--:--><!--:zh-->We hope by now that your Christmas gifts have broken and that you have already started hacking them! we've got a great line up this week of presenters, also keep an eye for Dork Bot announcement to be hosted on the 19th.
