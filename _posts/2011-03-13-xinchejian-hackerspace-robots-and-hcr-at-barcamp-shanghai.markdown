<h2>XinCheJian was in <a href="http://techyizu.org/event-march-12-barcamp-shanghai">Barcamp Shanghai</a>! </h2></p>
<h3>We took the Green for the afternoon to talk about Hackerspace, Maker, Open Source Hardware and of course ROBOTS!!! ;) </h3></p>

<h3>The crazy robot car David was carrying around at Barcamp</h3></p>
<p>The robot was built the night before barcamp with <a href="http://xinchejian.com/?p=511">YM4 from Embedream</a>, Arduino Uno and a <a href="http://iteadstudio.com/produce/cheap-cheap-ultrasonic-ranging-modulehc-sr04/">HC-SR04</a>. The little YM4 is a lot of fun. The independently controlled wheels allowing the car to turn on a fix axis and this saves the use to savor to turn the limited angle SR04 around to inspect the environment. But at 3AM, it was discovered a little drawback of controlling two independent wheels while trying to make the it going straight. Well, it was 3AM so I decide to let it acts a little crazy. I am dedicating this crazy robot to the crazy Shanghai taxi driver who took me to the barcamp in the morning! I will name it 840. ;) </p></p>

<h3>Pitching Hackerspace</h3></p>
<p>Kicking off the afternoon with pitch of Hackerspace and Maker Culture</p></p>

<p>Hmm, this is why the call this session "THE GREEN." Get to make fun of making is much more fun then golf as hobby.</p></p>

<h3>HCR, the open source robots from DFRobot</h3></p>
<p><a href="http://www.yerobot.com">Rick Ye<a> gave a talk on his <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hcrobot/">open source HCR robot.</a> I was driving it around to round up people to the talk. This version has a cam pointing upward and a automated navigation mode. It's a lot of fun to watch it walking all over the place on its own from the video at the control.</p></p>

<p>This little guy has great potential to be a good caddy on the green.</p></p>
