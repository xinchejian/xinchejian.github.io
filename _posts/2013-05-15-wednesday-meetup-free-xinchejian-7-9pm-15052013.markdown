<h3>Wednesday Presenters/本周演讲者介绍</h3></p>
<ul>
<li>Oculus rift, you've heard so much about it but have you experienced it? tonight we have a hands on demonstration.. simulate falling from the sky in an intense hyper interaction.</li>
<li>Lio is going to be giving an introduction to D Programming and why it makes sense to learn D instead of C++ where the programming paradigm is better suited. This will follow on later next month with a workshop to getting started with D.</li>
