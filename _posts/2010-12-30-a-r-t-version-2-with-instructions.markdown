<p>Today I built a second new A.R.T. to test new configurations.</p></p>
<p>It's also because it is a bit frustrating not to have a working version at all times for demos while I'm trying out new mechanical layouts...  I took the opportunity to write down a detailed list of parts, tools and steps that I've checked in to github (note that I have not finished as I still have to solve the ranging sensor and write a new program):</p></p>
