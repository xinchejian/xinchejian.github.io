<p><!--:zh-->In addition to all usual Xinchejian goodness of sharing and helping, we are going to trial regular "Helper sessions" where:-</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>All questions welcome<&#47;li>
<li>We all share and help each other<&#47;li>
<li>Make &amp; hack stuff - anything!<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol><br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .... one theme will be assistive devices as this covers a huge range of technology!<&#47;p><br />
Anyone is free to suggest other themes!</p>
<p>All languages are welcome.</p>
<p>Proposed guidelines</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Display "Helper sessions" welcome sign - so people know were to come (don't be shy !)<&#47;li>
<li>Setup at one table&#47;area - with chairs and clean workspace.<&#47;li>
<li>Noisy discussions should move to another area, so main group can continue.<&#47;li>
<li>Share and document - let other people know if you had a good time, or learnt something (or not)
<ul>
<li>Ask for wiki account and how to use the wiki!<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;li></p>
<li>You need to be a member<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">These sessions are intended to extend the always great help available at anytime at&nbsp;Xinchejian :)<&#47;p><br />
Aim is to fit in between formal workshop&nbsp;Xinchejian learning and to give some relief to&nbsp;Xinchejian regular members as they often spend most of their time helping others.</p>
<p>THANKS for all the interest and support after Wednesday nights talk!</p>
<p>When:- Trial Thursday from 7:30 starting from 11th July. If any interest we can try other times, including weekends.</p>
<p>Where:- At <a title="Xinchejian location" href="http:&#47;&#47;xinchejian.com&#47;contact-us&#47;">Xinchejian<&#47;a></p>
<p>Cost:- Free, but members only (<a title="membership" href="http:&#47;&#47;xinchejian.com&#47;membership&#47;">100RMB per month, cheaper for longer periods<&#47;a>)</p>
<p>Links - Early draft pages have been started on the wiki:- <a title="Helper Sessions - XCJ wiki" href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.xinchejian.com&#47;wiki&#47;Helper_Sessions">Helper Sessions<&#47;a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a title="Assistive Devices XCJ wiki" href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.xinchejian.com&#47;wiki&#47;Assistive_Devices">Assistive Devices <&#47;a>These will be added to in coming days and weeks.</p>
<p>Note "Helper sessions" is a draft name - fits in with Maker, hacker, and also fits in with assistive technology. Any better suggestions?<!--:--><!--:en-->In addition to all usual Xinchejian goodness of sharing and helping, we are going to trial regular "Helper sessions" where:-</p>
