<p><!--:en-->Shyu Lee from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.meteroi.com">Meteroi<&#47;a> came by the space and he wants to help with ARM&#47;FPGA classes, &nbsp;buying components, spare parts and providing some of his own hardware so members can experiment.</p>
<p>His big project at the moment is software radio with hardware-acceleration. The hardware component will have a USB and&#47;or Ethernet interface to PC to be compatible with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.gnuradio.org">GNURadio<&#47;a>.&nbsp;Another similar project, from Microsoft, is&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;research.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;projects&#47;sora&#47;">SORA<&#47;a>. His innovation is to provide an higher performance hardware solution; while other solutions rely on computers for processing and ADC&#47;DAC interface to do the data acquisition, he has everything done in hardware. He's currently looking for a supportive university or other organization to support his work full-time for 3 to 5 years so he can focus on software integration and hardware improvements.&nbsp;You can read the proposal "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.flexsdr.com&#47;Proposal.pdf">An Open Source General Purpose Software Defined Radio Development Platform<&#47;a>" (note that the project name will be changed because of trademark conflict).</p>
<p>He's also really interested in space communication; one of his project is to bounce a radio signal off the moon. Radio communication with space will be very useful to communicate with our space robots as part of the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;xinchejian.com&#47;category&#47;100yss&#47;">100YSS project<&#47;a>.</p>

<p>He'll be giving a class on ARM and FPGA at XinCheJian Saturday December 10th using his own development platform, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.meteroi.com&#47;node&#47;22">DevStation 1000E<&#47;a>. He will be leaving one development station for members interested in getting some practical skills after the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;xinchejian.com&#47;event&#47;?ee=82">introductory session<&#47;a>&nbsp;at XinCheJian (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;xinchejian.com&#47;event&#47;?ee=82">Register Now!<&#47;a>)<!--:--></p>
