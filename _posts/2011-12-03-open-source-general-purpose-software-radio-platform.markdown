<p><!--:en-->Shyu Lee from <a href="http://www.meteroi.com">Meteroi</a> came by the space and he wants to help with ARM/FPGA classes, &nbsp;buying components, spare parts and providing some of his own hardware so members can experiment.</p>
<p>His big project at the moment is software radio with hardware-acceleration. The hardware component will have a USB and/or Ethernet interface to PC to be compatible with <a href="http://www.gnuradio.org">GNURadio</a>.&nbsp;Another similar project, from Microsoft, is&nbsp;<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/sora/">SORA</a>. His innovation is to provide an higher performance hardware solution; while other solutions rely on computers for processing and ADC/DAC interface to do the data acquisition, he has everything done in hardware. He's currently looking for a supportive university or other organization to support his work full-time for 3 to 5 years so he can focus on software integration and hardware improvements.&nbsp;You can read the proposal "<a href="http://www.flexsdr.com/Proposal.pdf">An Open Source General Purpose Software Defined Radio Development Platform</a>" (note that the project name will be changed because of trademark conflict).</p>
<p>He's also really interested in space communication; one of his project is to bounce a radio signal off the moon. Radio communication with space will be very useful to communicate with our space robots as part of the <a href="http://xinchejian.com/category/100yss/">100YSS project</a>.</p>

<p>He'll be giving a class on ARM and FPGA at XinCheJian Saturday December 10th using his own development platform, <a href="http://www.meteroi.com/node/22">DevStation 1000E</a>. He will be leaving one development station for members interested in getting some practical skills after the <a href="http://xinchejian.com/event/?ee=82">introductory session</a>&nbsp;at XinCheJian (<a href="http://xinchejian.com/event/?ee=82">Register Now!</a>)<!--:--></p>
