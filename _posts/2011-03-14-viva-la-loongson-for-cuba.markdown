<p>Loongson the Chinese MISP CPU is making news as China launched the new supercomputer totally based on this CPU. At barcamp, there was a session called "Lemote => Cuba." Kind of cryptic. As I passed by the room, I saw a long time open source friend sitting inside. I pop my head in and realize it's the Jiangsu based <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.lemote.com&#47;en&#47;" target="_blank">Lemote<&#47;a> which makes desktop computers based on Loongson CPU.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Talked to the speaker Dr. Qiao and he said the box are shipped to 41 countries and one of the biggest customers is Cuba for only a few hundreds RMB each. The size of the box is about the same as Cuban Cigar box. Kind of funny mental picture of exchanging Linux box for cigar. The box runs Lemote-Linux and Loongson 2B at 900 Mhz. There are no fan inside the box so it's totally quiet and low power consumption.<&#47;p></p>
<p>It's also kind of interesting to think this Linux box is one of the force stopping the MS&#47;Intel invasion of Cuba. Freedom box from China to Cuba? How ironical is that?<&#47;p></p>
