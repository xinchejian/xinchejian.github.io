<p>It was a chaotic afternoon with unexpected turn out for the Robo contest kick off and we were overwhelmed by the 60+ people shown up for the event and packing the 1F of <a href="http://xindanwei.com">Xindanwei</a> end to end. </p>
<p>Ricky kicks off the event with <a href="http://xinchejian.com/?p=289">A.R.T.</a> and gave a short introduction to how he got started with the project and how ART was built. </p>

<p>Then we have the introduction to the HCR robots by the presenter also named Ricky. HCR is an open source robot built to for home caring.</p>
