<p>Tony Bacigalupo from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;nwc.co">New Work City<&#47;a> blogs about <a href="http:&#47;&#47;happymonster.co&#47;2011&#47;08&#47;22&#47;coworking-in-tokyo-shanghai-and-hong-kong&#47;">his visit to XinCheJian during his pan-Asian coworking space tour<&#47;a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shanghai is a rich, beautiful, well-manicured city. My hotel was right in the middle of a touristy shopping district which exemplified Shanghai&rsquo;s polish.</p>
<p>Xinchejian, Shanghai&rsquo;s hackerspace, was nowhere near this part of town. Appropriately, Xinchejian is in a far more &ldquo;real&rdquo; part of town, away from the rich expats and the manicured shopping experiences.</p>
<p>That also meant narrow roads not designed for two way traffic, a hard-to-find location hidden away in an ancient warehouse, and a parking situation that required negotiation with locals. In other words, not too dissimliar from the usual neighborhoods one might find a hackerspace nested away in.</p>
<p>I walked into Xinchejian and might as well have walked into NYC Resistor. Gadgets and witty signage everywhere. A Makerbot in the house. Some kind of agriculture project involving running water between two potted plants through a fish tank. And don&rsquo;t miss the freelance beehive in the slide show.</p>
<p>Founder Ricky was an engineer at Google and is working on some awesome projects while running the space, which is naturally a very loose and community-driven operation. What appeared to be an emergency glass box on the wall was actually a donation box into which people put money for just about anything.</p>
<p>I felt right at home here. I sat on a couch made of spare bamboo with Ricky as he talked with Liu Yan, owner of Xindanwei described below, as they discussed business and local things.<&#47;blockquote></p>
