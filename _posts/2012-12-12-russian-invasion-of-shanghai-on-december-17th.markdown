<p>Strelka is an interdisciplinary institution, founded in Moscow, Russia 3 years ago. Its main topic is Urbanism and everything related&nbsp;to big cities and people, living there.</p>
<p>Strelka Institute is a non-profit organization aimed at generating knowledge, producing new ideas and making them come true. Strelka lecture&nbsp;halls and studios provide free tuition for international young specialists with backgrounds in architecture, design, social sciences,&nbsp;etc. Strelka&nbsp;courtyard hosts open lectures, conferences and film screenings. Strelka&nbsp;bar provides both a place for the social networking of&nbsp;creative people from around the globe and a source of Strelka&rsquo;s financial backing: what the bar earns goes to support the institute.</p>
<p>Strelka is an educational centre that is open to the world and ready to share. What happens here spills out into social exchanges. The output of the institute is multidimensional: it includes graduates and their projects and involves a growing network of creativity. But, most importantly, it helps shape the reality of tomorrow.</p>
