<div>Are you interested in working on Quantified Self (QS) hardware or software projects? Do you have experience with biosensors or self-tracking? Welcome!<&#47;div></p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
<div>The goal of the Quantified Self group at Xinchejian is to develop new projects and continue working on existing QS projects. This can include self-tracking, biosensors, hacking existing devices or building new ones! Please feel free to join even if you don't have a project idea but are a user of self-tracking devices and you would like to share your experiences.&nbsp;All participants will have an opportunity to give a brief description and&#47;or demo of their project, idea, or self-tracking experience, and we will then breakout into smaller groups based on shared interests.<&#47;div></p>

<p>Quantified Self is a collaboration of users and tool makers who share an interest in self knowledge through self-tracking. We exchange information about our personal projects, the tools we use, tips we&rsquo;ve gleaned, lessons we&rsquo;ve learned. We blog, meet face to face, and collaborate online. There are three main &ldquo;branches&rdquo; to our work.</p>
<p>*The Quantified Self blog and community site. You are here! This is the central hub, where we keep track of all important goings-on, and you will soon be able to make connections, develop ongoing collaborations, and share detailed documentation of your personal projects.</p>
<p>*<a href="http:&#47;&#47;quantified-self.meetup.com&#47;" target="_blank">Quantified Self Show&Tell meetings<&#47;a>. These are face-to-face meetings, very fun and interesting, where you can see QS projects first hand and meet QS people in your local area. The meetings started in the&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.meetup.com&#47;quantifiedself&#47;" target="_blank">San Francisco Bay Area<&#47;a>, but local chapters are springing up&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;quantified-self.meetup.com&#47;" target="_blank">all over the world<&#47;a>.

<div>The goal of the Quantified Self Workgroup at Xinchejian is to develop new Quantified Self projects. This can include self-tracking, biosensors, hacking existing devices or building new software or hardware projects!<&#47;div></p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
<div>At this meeting we will hack the first prototypes of some of the self-tracking and biosensor related ideas that people brought up at the Show &amp; Tell event (see below - I will add to the wiki soon). All are welcome to join a project team or test some ideas for a new prototype.<&#47;div></p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
<div>There are two main goals: 1) test out one or more biosensors (heart rate &#47; brainwave &#47; iphone app with built-in sensor) to get a feel for the data, and &nbsp;2) start working on an actual prototype or demo your existing project.<&#47;div></p>
<div><&#47;div></p>
